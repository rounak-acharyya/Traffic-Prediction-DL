# <p align="center"> Traffic Volume Prediction Using Deep Learning </p>


## 🚦 Introduction:

Traffic prediction is very important for any urban city, especially in crowded areas. Predicting traffic can be very useful for managing future traffic. Therefore, the idea proposed for this project is to use deep learning algorithms to help us predict traffic at a certain time and location. The goal of the project is to help smart cities have a better understanding of traffic patterns that leads to better management of traffic and solves many problems related to infrastructure and safety.



## 📊 Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of datetime, vehicles, and junction information. The data is collected from sensors at every junction. It has over 48, 000 observations and was obtained as an open-source from Kaggle, [Here.](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/traffic-prediction-dataset)

## 🧠 Solution Approach
We build separate GRU-based deep learning models to capture temporal dependencies in traffic flow at four different junctions.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Parsing datetime

Extracting features like year, month, day, hour, day of the week, and quarter

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Histograms and line plots to analyze traffic distribution

Correlation matrix to assess feature relationships

Data Transformation:

Normalization and differencing to stationarize the time series

Feature Engineering:

Creating input-output sequences for sequence modeling

Model Building:

GRU layers with dropout for regularization

Early stopping to prevent overfitting

Model Evaluation:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Comparative line plots of predictions vs. actual values
